Question 3

2.This program simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures. In each time 
step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent 
list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in 
the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that 
type of animal, which is placed in a random empty location in the 
list (if there is no empty location in the list, the newly generated animal will be 
discarded). If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies.
